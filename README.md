About
The ViGEmBus driver and ViGEmClient libraries represent the core of the Virtual Gamepad Emulation Framework (or ViGEm , for short). ViGEm aims for a 100% accurate emulation of well-known gaming peripherals as pure software-based devices at kernel level. As it mimics "the real thing" games and other processes require no additional modification whatsoever to detect ViGEm-based devices (no Proxy-DLLs or API-Hooking) and simply work out of the box. While the (now obsolete) Scarlett.Crush Productions Virtual Bus Driver is the spiritual father of this project, ViGEm has been designed and written from the ground up utilizing Microsoft's Kernel-Mode Driver Framework.

Emulated devices
Emulation of the following USB Gamepads is supported:

Microsoft Xbox 360 Controller
Sony DualShock 4 Controller
Use cases
A few examples of the most common use cases for ViGEm are:

You have an unsupported input device you'd like to use within games without modifying said game.
You want the freedom to use a different controller of your choice in PS4 Remote Play.
You encountered a game not compatible with x360ce (prior to version 4.x).
You want to extend the reach of your input device (like send traffic to a different machine over a network).
You want to test/benchmark your game and need a replay mechanism for your user inputs.
You want to work around player slot assignment order issues in XInput.
Supported Systems
ðŸ›‘ Windows Server might work but is not supported ðŸ›‘

Bug reports/support requests regarding running on a Server OS will be discarded.

How to build
Prerequisites
Step 1: Install Visual Studio 2019
Step 2: Install WDK for Windows 10, version 2004
Step 3: Clone the Driver Module Framework (DMF) into the same parent directory.
Build the DmfK project with Release and Debug configurations for all architectures (x64 and Win32).
You can build directly within Visual Studio.

Do bear in mind that you'll need to sign the driver to use it without test mode.
